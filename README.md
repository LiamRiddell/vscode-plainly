# Welcome to Plainly ðŸ‘‹

Plainly is a VS Code extension that helps write simpler and clearer copy. It suggests hundreds of plain English alternatives to complex, non-inclusive, and unsuitable words. Wordlists are aimed for UI copy, user guide articles, and technical documentation.

## What's inside
Plainly scans your writing and spots the issues around:
- Complex and redundant wording
- Gender-biased terms
- Technical jargon
- Culturally-sensitive words
- Ableism
