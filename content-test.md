The app highlights lengthy, complex sentences and common errors; if you see a yellow sentence, shorten or split it. If you see a red highlight, your sentence is so dense and complicated that your readers will get lost trying to follow its meandering, splitting logic — try editing this sentence to remove the red.

You can utilize a shorter word in place of a purple one. Mouse over them for hints.

Adverbs and weakening phrases are helpfully shown in blue. Get rid of them and pick words with force, perhaps.

Phrases in green have been marked to show passive voice.

You can format your text with the toolbar.

Paste in something you're working on and edit away. Or, click the Write button and compose something new. And it is absolutely true!

Overview

Brokermint allows organizations in the United States to pay agents or partners via the automated clearing house (ACH) network. There are three steps required in order to make an ACH payment:

    Connect the payment gateway
    Connect a bank account
    Make an ACH payment

Setting Up ACH
How do I connect the Payload gateway?
Step 1

From any page, go to the Accounting page, then select the Payment gateways tab. Click Connect gateway and select Payload.

Step 2

You will be redirected to fill out the Payload form. In a form, you’ll be requested to provide:

    Funding account information
    Most recent bank statements
    Business information (including Legal Name, Tax ID, etc.)
    Beneficial/Control ownership information
    Processing information

The Payload connection form asks for 2 months of bank statements. If your company has no statements to add, validate your account by attaching some bank letters from your business name.

After submitting the form, your Payload gateway integration status will be set as Pending.

Step 3

When Payload confirms your request, you’ll get an email notification and the PENDING badge will be removed.
